# Lab 2: Create a simple web page
Getting your feet wet with HTML and CSS

## In this lab you will accomplish the following:
 - Create a one page website using HTML
 - Style your website with CSS

## Create a one page website
 - In this repository there is a file named `index.html`. This will be the file that contains the HTML of your one page website. You are tasked with adding the following content to the empty website:
   - The tab of the web page should say: "[your name]'s first website", i.e. my Chrome tab would say: "Kay's first website"
   	- Think about the tags that you should use for each piece of content
    - The content of the website should be formated like the following:

---
# `[your name]'s First website!`
## `Created on [today's date]`

`[start of paragraph]
    	Hello World! This is my first website and I am very excited. I've always wanted to learn how websites work and I'm well on my way to finding out!
[end of paragraph]`

---

## Style your website with CSS
 - Edit the empty CSS style sheet file `style.css` in the CSS folder and do the following:
 	- Make all headers pink
 	- Make all paragraph text blue
 - Link your web page to your CSS page

And as always, commit and push your changes to your personal repository to submit your homework.

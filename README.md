# Lab 2: Create a simple web page
Getting your feet wet with HTML and CSS

## In this lab you will accomplish the following:
 - Create a one page website using HTML
 - Style your website with CSS
 
## Load up your vagrant box
 - Open a new terminal
 - Type the command ```cd i253``` to open the i253 folder
 - Type ```vagrant ssh``` to log into your box
 - Navigate to ```cd /vagrant``` to change directory to your synced vagrant folder
 - Clone your repo in this directory
 
Note \#1: Now you should have created a lab-2-\[username\] folder inside this vagrant folder

Note \#2: Note that now that you cloned your repo in the ```/vagrant``` folder, your files should be synced to your host computer. So now if you go to the folder that contains the Vagrantfile that you created last week, you should see a lab2-\[username\] folder there. This is the same folder that was cloned in your vagrant box. So you can edit files here using tools like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io) or any text editor you choose.

Note \#3: This note was done in class, so don't freak out when you see this in your repo

## Create a one page website
 - In this repository there is a file named `index.html`. This will be the file that contains the HTML of your one page website. You are tasked with adding the following content to the empty website:
   - The tab of the web page should say: "[your name]'s first website", i.e. my Chrome tab would say: "Kay's first website"
   	- Think about the tags that you should use for each piece of content
    - The content of the website should be formated like the following (ignore the horizontal rules):

---
# [your name]'s First website!
## Created on [today's date]

[start of paragraph]
    	Hello World! This is my first website and I am very excited. I've always wanted to learn how websites work and I'm well on my way to finding out!
[end of paragraph]

---

## Style your website with CSS
 - Edit the empty CSS style sheet file `style.css` in the CSS folder and do the following:
 	- Make all headers pink
 	- Make all paragraph text blue
 - Link your web page to your CSS page

And as always, commit and push your changes to your personal repository to submit your homework.
